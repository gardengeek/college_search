This is a mvp program that allows the user to search
for colleges, and displays the location of the colleges
on a google map. It only displays the first page of
colleges returned by the CollegeScorecard, which
is 20 colleges.

- In the future:
  - this could be expanded to include more colleges.
  - The UI could be improved

Locally, this can be run by cloning the repository,
running `bundle install`, then starting the server.

It can then be accessed with the following url:
http://localhost:3000/college_search
